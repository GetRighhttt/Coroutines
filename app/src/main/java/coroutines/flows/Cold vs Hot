What are Cold and Hot Flows?

Cold Flow:
- Emits values only when a collector is attached.
- Each collector receives the entire stream of values from the beginning.
- Considered the default behavior for most data streams.
- Considered "lazy" as cold flows are only active when collected or published.
- Regular flows are typically the use of cold flows.

Hot Flow:
- Emits values even if no collector is listening.
- New collectors receive data from the point they start listening, not from the beginning.
- Useful for scenarios where multiple components need to be updated with the latest data
simultaneously.
- It remains in memory as long as the flow is collected or while any other references to it exist
from a garbage collection root.
- StateFlow, SharedFlow, Streams are all hot flows that are normally used when receiving values
in android data collection from apis.
