What are Flow Operators?

- Operators are methods within the reactive paradigm that allow you to manipulate and transform flow(
stream of data emitted over time). These operators can enable you to finish, start, filter, map,
combine, etc. to get your desired output.

- There are 3 types of operators that can be performed on Flows:
1. Terminal Operators - terminates a flow and ensures completion
2. Intermediate Operators - operators that are performed in between the flow emission and terminal
operators
3. Lifecycle Operators - operators that perform operations on the lifecycle of the flow
